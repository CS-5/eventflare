# Eventflare

## Introduction

### What this project is:

- A security guy's foray, diving (for essentially the first time) in to [React](https://reactjs.org/), [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/), [NextJS](https://nextjs.org/), [Lerna](https://lerna.js.org/), and [Cloudflare Workers](https://workers.cloudflare.com/).
- A fairly lightweight frontend and API for simple events such as weddings, open houses, meet ups, and more.
- A submission for the [Cloudflare Developer Summer Challenge](https://challenge.developers.cloudflare.com/)!
- (Eventually) my personal wedding website ðŸ˜Š

### What this project is not:

- The best example of how to work with the technologies and projects mentioned above (I'm learning 100% of this as I go... pull requests anyone?).
- A bullet-proof (both in security and functionality) solution for advertising and handling RSVP's for events. There are definitely some tweaks that should be made before it can be considered production-ready.
- A UI/UX design masterpiece.

### Where you can help (if you're interested):
