# Eventflare

![App Overview](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CS-5/eventflare/main/docs/app.png)

## Introduction

### What this project is:

- A security guy's foray, diving (for essentially the first time) in to [React](https://reactjs.org/), [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/), [NextJS](https://nextjs.org/), [Lerna](https://lerna.js.org/), and [Cloudflare Workers](https://workers.cloudflare.com/).
- A fairly lightweight frontend and API for simple events such as weddings, open houses, meet ups, and more.
- A submission for the [Cloudflare Developer Summer Challenge](https://challenge.developers.cloudflare.com/)!
- (Eventually) my personal wedding website ðŸ˜Š

### What this project is not:

- The best example of how to work with the technologies and projects mentioned above (I'm learning 100% of this as I go... pull requests anyone?).
- A bullet-proof (both in security and functionality) solution for advertising and handling RSVP's for events. There are definitely some tweaks that should be made before it can be considered production-ready.
- A UI/UX design masterpiece.

### Where you can help (if you're interested):

If you happened to stumble upon this project and think it's neat, see ways it can be improved, or have a suggestion - by all means please share it! This project is half-learning experience, half-working app.

## Development and Configuration

_TODO: This section needs updating for CF Pages Functions_

See the respective README's in [`packages/api`](https://github.com/CS-5/eventflare/tree/main/packages/api) and [`packages/web`](https://github.com/CS-5/eventflare/tree/main/packages/web) for more information about those specific packages. While you're here though:

1. Make sure to run `npm install` to install the dependencies for all packages and install Cloudflare Wrangler `npm install -g @cloudflare/wrangler`.
2. Configure your Wrangler deployment in [`packages/api/wrangler.toml`](https://github.com/CS-5/eventflare/blob/main/packages/api/wrangler.toml).
3. Customize the application however you'd like. This is less-so a static site generator "template" and more of a forkable boilerplate.

### Optional: Automated Deployments

For automated deployments, make sure to make note of the workflow defined in [`.github/workflows/deploy.yml`](https://github.com/CS-5/eventflare/blob/main/.github/workflows/deploy.yml). This workflow requires two repository secrets to be defined:

- `CF_API_TOKEN` Your Cloudflare API token with permission to manage workers.
- `CF_PAGES_HOOK` the Cloudflare Pages hook URL to preform a "manual" build/deploy of your pages project.

The workflow is triggered on new tags. This is fairly simple with Lerna:

`npx lerna version` (may need `--force-publish` in some situations).

### Cloudflare Pages

Because of how this project is structured, Cloudflare pages can act slightly weird. A few settings that could/should be tweaked:

- The build environment is NextJS
- The build command should be `cd packages/web && npm install && npm run build && npm run export`. This makes sure the right dependencies are installed and forces NPM to run the NextJS build commands.
- The root directory should be `/`. This is required to ensure Cloudflare Pages can access the `packages/lib` directory.
- I chose to disable building on Pull Requests, and since deployments are triggered by a webhook, I paused automated deployments.

## Frontend

The goal with the web frontend is to create an easily modifiable, flexible, and lightweight event page, with support for an RSVP form, schedule of events, location, and more. The RSVP form submits its content to the Eventflare API, to be handled in whatever way makes the most sense.

### To-Do

- [ ] Add more polish to the UI
- [ ] Form security?
- [ ] Make the site easier to customize (possibly convert it to a static-site generator theme?)

### Development and Configuration

1. As described in the project root's [README](https://github.com/CS-5/eventflare), Lerna is used to manage shared dependencies and handle publishing. To install dependencies, first run: `npm install` from the project root. _Note: This command doesn't always seem to work (still learning exactly how to do monorepos) so if there are missing dependencies, `npm install` within an individual package folder usually fixes them._

2. Update the constants in `constants.ts` and the environment variables from `.env.example` to set up the frontend (includes setting up the type/format of the email sending function)

3. Update any of the custom `theme-` extensions in `tailwind.config.js` to customize colors, fonts, and more across the site.

4. Update any icons/images in the `public` directory.

5. Dive in to the code itself and tweak it!

6. Building is as simple as `npm run build` followed by `npm run export` to create the static files.
